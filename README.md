# docker-cloudera-director

This project defines a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for running the [Cloudera Director](https://www.cloudera.com/products/product-components/cloudera-director.html) server.

Current version: **6.0.0**

## Caveats

Although I'm a developer who works on Cloudera Director, this is not an official Cloudera project, so do not expect support from Cloudera (or myself, potentially) for this project. Also, I'm not a Docker expert, so as usual, proceed with using this image at your own risk.

## Usage

### Pull from Docker Hub

To get the latest:

```
docker pull havanki4j/cloudera-director
```

Browse the tags available at the [repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/havanki4j/cloudera-director/) to find images for different versions of Cloudera Director.

### Build Yourself

Assuming an image tag of "cloudera-director", run the Cloudera Director image:

```
docker build -t cloudera-director .
docker run -p 7189:7189 cloudera-director
```

The image exposes TCP port 7189, so be sure to publish the port when running. Then, point your browser to the published port to use the Cloudera Director server UI.

To stop the container:

```
docker stop <container-id>
```

### Volumes

The directories /home/director/db and /home/director/logs are declared as volumes in the image for storing the Director database and logs, respectively. Save these volumes across container runs to keep state and log history. See Docker documentation for how to manage them.
